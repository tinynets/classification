# Classification

Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning, which is a subset of Data Science.

Most Data Science tasks can be bucketed into either Regression or Classification and so I thought I
would document the process of solving a simple Classification task, as a template for future me,
and anyone else who needs it.

## Brief Description

In this repo I will train MNIST, documenting various parts of the process as I go
along. I will use sklearn, and there will not be as much exposition because this is not a very
complex thing to do and there's thousands of tutorials on how to get this done.
